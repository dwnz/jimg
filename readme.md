# JSON Image Format

Ever wanted to use JSON instead of JPGS? Yeah me neither, but I did it anyway.

### Running it

Run jimg.html in a web server and Chrome and watch the magic

### Making an Image

Run the app in the generator folder. Change the path first.

### Should I use this on my website?

Probably not. Though it's up to you!

### Is this for real?

Well, the code is. The idea is. But was basically done to see if it would work.

### Can I improve it?

Sure.
